                                                _printf Custom Function

                                                      Description

    This project involves creating a custom _printf function in C, which emulates the behavior of the standard printf function found in the C standard library. The goal is to understand the inner workings of formatted output conversion and to handle various conversion specifiers.

The custom _printf function supports the following conversion specifiers:

    %c: Prints a single character.

    %s: Prints a string of characters.

    %d, %i: Prints signed decimal integers.

    %%: Prints a literal % character.

Note:

    This implementation is a simplified version and does not support all features of the standard printf function, such as field width, precision, or length modifiers.
